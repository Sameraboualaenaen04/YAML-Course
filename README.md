YAML is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for configuration files and data serialization. Unlike XML or JSON, YAML uses indentation to represent the structure of data, which makes it more readable and less cluttered.

Key Features of YAML
Human-Readable: YAML's syntax is designed to be easily readable by humans. It uses indentation and simple key-value pairs to represent data.

Data Serialization: YAML can serialize data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and scalars (strings, numbers, etc.), making it versatile for various applications.

Language-Agnostic: YAML is language-agnostic, meaning it can be used with many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and more.

Flexible: YAML supports complex data structures and can represent nested data, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

Common Use Cases
Configuration Files: YAML is widely used for configuration files in various applications and frameworks, such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.

Data Exchange: YAML is used for data exchange between different programming languages and systems.

Documentation: YAML can be used to write documentation in a structured and readable format.
